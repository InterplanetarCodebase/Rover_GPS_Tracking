# GPS Receiver Server (Python Flask)

This project contains a simple Python Flask web server designed to receive GPS coordinates sent from the Flutter mobile application (`rover_gps_tracker`). It listens for incoming HTTP POST requests, extracts the latitude and longitude, and prints them to the console.

---

### Features:

- **HTTP POST Listener:** Receives JSON data containing `latitude` and `longitude`.
- **Console Output:** Prints received coordinates in real-time.
- **Lightweight:** Built with Flask for minimal overhead.
- **Specific Port:** Listens on **port 5000**.

---

### Setup and Running the Server:

1.  **Clone the Monorepo:** If you haven't already, clone the main `RoverTrackingSolution` repository.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/RoverTrackingSolution.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/RoverTrackingSolution.git)
    cd RoverTrackingSolution/receiver_server_project
    ```
2.  **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python 3 and `pip` installed on your Linux machine.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    ```
3.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    (Your terminal prompt should now start with `(.venv)`).
4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python packages (Flask) using the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (This `requirements.txt` file is generated by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` while the virtual environment is active and Flask is installed).
5.  **Run the Server:**
    Once dependencies are installed and your virtual environment is active, you can start the server:
    ```bash
    python3 receiver_server.py
    ```
    The server will start listening on `0.0.0.0:5000`. Keep this terminal window open; received coordinates will be printed here.

### Server Endpoint Details:

- **Listening Port:** `5000`
- **Endpoint:** `/send-coordinates` (This is where the Flutter app sends POST requests).
- **Expected Payload (JSON POST):**
  ```json
  {
    "latitude": 12.345678,
    "longitude": 98.765432,
    "timestamp": "2025-06-14T14:30:00.000Z"
  }
  ```

### Finding Your Laptop's IP Address:

The Flutter app needs your laptop's IP address to send data.

1.  Open a terminal on your Linux laptop.
2.  Run the command: `ip a`
3.  Look for your active network interface (e.g., `wlp2s0` for Wi-Fi) and find the `inet` address. This is your local IP (e.g., `192.168.0.140`).
4.  Ensure your phone and laptop are on the same Wi-Fi network.
